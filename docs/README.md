# Microsoft Student Accelerator 2021

Welcome to MSA 2021! The program provides a series of virtual bootcamps and complementing workshops. Regardless of your previous knowledge, all students in Australia are welcome. Throughout the whole program, you will learn about technical and soft skills that will benefit your future career.

We value all our participants and always aim to provide them the best experience possible. Last year in MSA 2020, we supported thousands of students across Melbourne and Sydney to become more work-ready by hosting workshops on industry-relevant topics such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things.

This website is a place where we publish all information about the program in 2021. This includes an introduction to the program, timeline and details of bootcamps during the entire program.
