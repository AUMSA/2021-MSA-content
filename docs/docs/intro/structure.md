# Structure of the program

### How will the program be organised?

The MSA 2021 program will host a series of bootcamps and complementing workshops online. You can choose to take part in the whole programme or part of it – no strings attached. The programme is designed by students alongside Microsoft professionals to give you flexibility around your other commitments while maintaining some structure.

### Three phrases throughout the program

​There will be three phases. The first phase will support students to complete the Azure Fundamentals certification with a workshop and a free voucher to complete the exam and get certified. In the latter phases, participants will be able to create and submit a project on bootcamp topics to consolidate their learnings and they are expected to complete in their own time. The projects are part of MSA program’s assessment and will help students accumulate points. In addition to projects, students can engage in Microsoft Learn platform to learn you concepts and skills. Completing modules and pathways on such platform will also accumulate them points. 

### How do participants interact with the program?

Throughout the program, the participants will have access to exclusive tools, resources and networking events with Microsoft. We will also provide additional support throughout the whole program in forms of online discussion through social media and emails.
