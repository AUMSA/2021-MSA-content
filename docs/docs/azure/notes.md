We covered an overview of cloud computing and key concepts that you will need to learn to get certified. 
#### 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: 
We showed that there are three different types of cloud models: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. Then, we provided some details about different types of cloud services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS). 
#### 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 
We presented core components in Azure architecture such as Region, Availability Options, Availability Zones, and Resource Groups. This helps you further manage your cloud services in Microsoft Azure. 
#### 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘀:
We provided the description of each fundamental Azure service or product in a particular group (e.g., Azure compute, Azure network, Azure storage, Azure database, or Azure Marketplace) 
#### 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: 
We elaborated on the groupings of Azure services and products into solutions (e.g., Internet of Things, Big data and analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Serverless computing, and DevOps). 
#### 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: 
We covered some tools in Microsoft Azure that support the user to manage billing and usage of resources. In addition, we presented tools such as Azure Monitor and Azure Service Health which help users monitor the health of the system. 
#### 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗔𝘇𝘂𝗿𝗲: 
We covered the security of different network layers in cloud computing with Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups. Afterward, we introduced fundamental Azure services such as Azure Firewall, Azure DDoS protection, and Azure Advanced Threat Protection that helps the user prevent their services from being insecure threats. Finally, we provided the description of each fundamental Azure identity service such as Azure Active Directory (AD), Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, Azure Security Center, Azure Key Vault, or Azure Information Protection that further supports authentication and authorization. 

### Recap 1 – Azure services and architectural components

To help you prepare for the exam, we would like to provide a list of questions to supplement your understanding of cloud computing, Azure services, and other important topics that were covered in the #1 Bootcamp.

➤ In which use cases will we use “Azure Resource Manager”?<br/>

### Recap 2 – Core Azure products and Azure solutions 

To help you understand Azure products, services, and Azure solutions in the #1 Bootcamp, we would like to provide some questions that will help you better understand our second topic in the #1 bootcamp. Please note that the purpose of these questions is only to consolidate the knowledge that you gained through our #1 bootcamp, not an exam practice. 

#### Core Azure products and services:  
➤ What are available Azure Compute services? <br/>
➤ In which use cases should we use Azure Compute service? <br/>
