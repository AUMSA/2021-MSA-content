# Introduction to Microsoft Student Accelerator 2021

The Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA) programme works with students to provide industry relevant training and put those skills in practice to develop innovative solutions to the challenging problems in the world today.

Throughout the MSA 2021 program, you will be building your technical skillset by attending bootcamps, workshops, completing projects, and the Azure certification exam over a course of 8 months guided by Microsoft professionals and Student Ambassadors.

The top performing and proactive students will then be selected for work placements by our partner companies during the summer. This can be your opportunity to accumulate practical experience that you can showcase on your CV, gain a competitive edge when you graduate, build connections within the industry and start your career with innovation at its core.
